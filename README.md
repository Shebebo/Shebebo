Hey I'm Shebebo (Shane),
I am a System Admin and interested in becoming a cloud engineer. 
I am currently learning Python. 
I am working on a project for work that involves using Python on a windows PC to open a site, log in to an account, navigate to a specific page on the site, and display it on a TV. 
Making scripts and programs is very rewarding to me and despite my inexperience I thouroughly enjoy it :)
